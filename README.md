In a multi-project setup containing one or many Java-based projects, Javadocs are only created for individual subprojects.
There are certain use cases that requires you merge Javadocs for all subprojects of your build. Creating a reusable library
that is partitioned into sub-functionality but shipped together is a typical example. This plugin adds a task to the root
 project of the build allowing to aggregate Javadocs across all subprojects.

## Usage

### Applying the Plugin

To include, add the following to your build.gradle

    buildscript {
        repositories { jcenter() }

        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.netflix.nebula:gradle-aggregate-javadocs-plugin:2.2.+'
        }
    }

    apply plugin: 'nebula-aggregate-javadocs'

### Aggregating Javadocs

To aggregate Javadocs across all subprojects, execute the task `aggregateJavadocs` available to the root project. The task
declares a task dependencies on the task `javadoc` provided by the Java plugin. The resulting Javadoc report is located
in the directory `project.buildDir/docs/javadoc`.

### Configuring the Plugin

You can specify subprojects to include, in which case only those projects will be aggregated. Alternatively you can specify
subprojects to exclude, in which case all other projects will be aggregated. You may not specify both.

The sample below shows the configuration options.

    apply plugin: 'nebula-aggregate-javadocs'
    
    aggregateJavadocs {
        include 'subproject-name', 'other-subproject'
        exclude 'subproject-name', 'other-subproject'
    }
